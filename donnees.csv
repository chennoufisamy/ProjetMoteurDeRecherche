1,1,Sound and Light Question I've Been Thinking About Recently,Tymo566,2023/11/11,https://www.reddit.com//r/astrophysics/comments/17sp17o/sound_and_light_question_ive_been_thinking_about/,"Forewarning: This is kind of just a long ramble and nothing is really accomplished, but I would appreciate you hearing me out. I'm asking this as a 17 year-old who's just getting into college level astronomy classes. I know I have a lot to learn, but I'm very interested. Not sure if this is just physics or more astrophysics, but I'm going to try here. I am open to any feedback.How is it that light and sound can be measured on the same scale, being frequency in Hertz?I know things like the speed of light and the speed of sound are vastly different, and I know that sound essentially doesn't travel in space due to the greater distance between particles.I think of sound sort of as the frequency at which particles are colliding, like when a car drives by. Increasing frequency as it approaches, peaks as it passes, and decreasing frequency as it drives away.Sound seems like a form of energy given off when particles collide and works in waves, yet light is an energy given of as particles collide and works in waves, but it actually can be a particle. See, in the Astronomy college class I'm taking right now, I was recently introduced to how red-shifts and blue-shifts work, at least in determining which direction a star is spinning or how stars in a binary system orbit each other. I proceeded to go on a tangent from my work and seek put specific information such as the frequencies for red and blue visible light and compare that to how sound waves move in the car analogy I mentioned before.I understand that the ""Cosmic Background"" or whatever is imaged in radio waves, having the lowest frequency. I also understand that we see things such as nebulae because of the higher density of particles compared to the space around it. Another thing I learned from this class is how infrared light can pass through the space dust and allow us to see what is on the other side of or within the dust. It seems that lower frequencies are better at passing through objects, including nebulae, and higher frequencies are better at pin-pointing a specific object or amount of energy.I understand that I'm bouncing all over the place here and I'm not really making a point, but hear me out.I have been very interested in the sections of my astronomy textbooks regarding nuclear fusion in the cores of stars and how neutrinos and positrons are created in that process. In those textbooks, they has said that neutrinos are very hard to detect because they pass through most things. Is it possible for them to have extremely long wavelengths and equally low frequencies?In my head, I've kind of made up an idea that amplitude is about how much of a difference is made in its path, assuming this path is in a wave formation. Essentially, its displacement, seeming like a margin of error for where a particle should be at a specific time. While wavelength and amplitude do not have any direct relation, amplitude and frequency do. Their link is energy. Higher energy equals higher frequencies and greater amplitudes. Neutrinos are seen as next to 0 mass and are neutral. E=mc². Represented by c in the equation, the speed of light is a constant. E is energy and m is for whatever object's mass. If either the mass or energy of any specific amount of these particles can be identified, the other can be found too. Let's wrap back around to frequencies and wavelengths.This is looking at Wikipedia. I know its not the most reliable source. ""At the surface of the Earth, the flux is about 65 billion (6.5×1010) solar neutrinos, per second per square centimeter.""That flux is the ""intensity"" of a flow of neutrinos, which sounds similar to density.(6.5 x 10¹⁰ / sec) / cm²Square root the whole thing to get in terms of per centimeter(6.5x10⁵ / sec) / cm650,000 neutrinos fit in one centimeter each second1 cm / 650,000 = 0.0000015385 cm / neutrino1.5385 x 10^-7 cm1 cm = 10000 micrometers0.0000015385 x 10000 = 0.015385 micrometers / neutrinoTell you what, I've been writing this for about 2 hours now, and it is almost 2AM where I live, so I'm pretty tired. I'm at the point where I do a ton of unnecessary math for really no reason. If anyone has any feedback or wants me to continue down the rabbit hole, let me know. I don't think I really got across any point here, but in large part, sound and light seem directly related, just differences in energy. Neutrinos seem like they have an extremely small amount of energy because of their mass, thus seeming more in the range of sound than light. I wonder if we used more of an idea of sound instead of light, it would be easier to detect them. But I'm done for now, goodnight.",reddit,6

11,11,I have so many questions,Ok_Rip_2104,2023/11/08,https://www.reddit.com//r/astrophysics/comments/17qpglc/i_have_so_many_questions/,"I never understood how we can see the light of the early universe.  Unless the universe, for a brief time at least, were expanding faster than light, the light from the early universe should have blown past us.  How did we get this far away from the center of the universe in time to still see the light of early stars?It would make sense with curved space and the light is just making laps.  If space were curved (it doesn't need to be a uniform curve) and you looked far enough in one direction you could look at the milky way galaxy as seen billions of years ago from any direction and orientation and you wouldn't recognize it.  On that postulate, it would be very difficult to determine how many galaxies are actually in the universe and how many are visual echoes of the light flying in circles for billions of years.  Curved space would also explain why the universe is expanding in all directions from all points in space.If the universe were 4 or 5 dimensional everything would be moving in ""strange"" patterns.  Scaling could explain why the universe, at large, has different properties than your living room.  In your own living room, if you were to look at the behavior of subatomic particles, you would see odd behavior but if you WERE one of those subatomic particles and you could back out to see the living room, it would blow your mind.Also, why do stars emit light but black holes trap it?  Wouldn't the black hole have the same mass of the star... just squished?  Take a penny and squish it, it's still one penny's worth of mass, it's just denser now.  Does something new happen when you hit a certain density threshold?Thank you for attending my TED Talk. ",reddit,8

And no i am not on any drugs. Just a little curious.   Anyway i was going to boil some egg's the other day and was trying to distract my mind a bit while waiting for the water to boil and i got to think of a youtubevideo where they mention that ppl on the ISS age 0,007 sec slower every 6 month compare to the ppl on earth and explaned the concept behind Einstein's theory of relativity. And my mind just took me for a ride where it got me thinking of the flow of time and later took me in to a little rabbithole.   i googled some numbers and found out that Earth orbit the sun in around the sun in about 108 000km/h while Mars orbit in about 86 677 km/h. Since the ISS orbit in around 28 000km/t and that means the time moves slower with a factor of 0,007sec every 6 months and mars is moving about 22 000km/h slower in its orbit would that mean that times moves slower on mars then it does on earth? Not by much but over billions of years it would be some atleast a cuple of 1000 years?   Idk if i understood that right but just for a second assume that this is correct.  Sol-system is located kinda far out in the Orion arm in the galaxy milky way right? Thats spinns on a disk around the galaxys middle where the sun iteslf orbit around in this arm in about 828 000km/h Now as i said i am no astrophysics but i do know that the further out on a disk the faster/longer it travels.(thinking like gears on a bicycle) would that not mean that the Sun is likely to move faster in its orbit then some starts closer to the middle of the galaxy?   And would that not mean that the time moves in different phases/speed depending on the speed of witch stars gravitational force you ""follow"" compare to someone who ""follow"" a star traveling in a different velocity and that the ""avarage passing of time""  time moves different in each individual  galaxy depending on how fast a galaxy spins/travel from the point of origin?   Sooo... would that not mean that the whole universe is a different age depending on where in the universe you are? Here i got a headache and thought that this cant be right but i wanna ask someone about this so here i am \^\^   I know i know there is much ""would that not mean?"" or ""what ifs"" and so on. And i am not asking for a absolute answer. I would just like to know if this could be even remotely possible or if it got it all wrong from the start.

26,26,Advice for an astrophysics PhD student,SpectreMold,2023/11/05,https://www.reddit.com//r/astrophysics/comments/17o2pa7/advice_for_an_astrophysics_phd_student/," I am a third-year astrophysics PhD student on the verge of candidacy, specializing in star formation and working on observations. To provide some context, during my undergraduate studies, I engaged in purely theoretical work on pulsating variable stars, which involved extensive coding—a task I enjoyed. When applying to graduate schools, my preference was to work with a theorist; I had no interest in observational astronomy.At the institution where I am pursuing my PhD, I was unable to collaborate with a professor who focused on theoretical work due to funding limitations or a mismatch in research interests. Consequently, I joined forces with a newly hired assistant professor who specializes in observations within my desired subfield—anything related to the study of stars and planets. Despite this, my passion for observations has not developed: I am disinterested in using the campus observatory, engaging with advanced telescopes, or taking advanced observational astronomy courses. By this point, I have fulfilled my department's coursework requirements. Nevertheless, I have continued to work with my advisor because the work is tolerable—I do not need to collect new observational data; instead, I analyze existing data using Python. Moreover, we have an excellent rapport. They offer positive reinforcement, which I value as someone who deals with anxiety and self-doubt. Their enthusiasm for their subfield is infectious, and I cannot envision working with another professor.Reflecting on my PhD journey thus far, I have resolved to pursue a career in data science or computer software after graduation, for several professional and personal reasons:* [The starting salary in the private sector is higher than that of a postdoc](https://www.aip.org/statistics/reports/new-astronomy-phds-what-comes-next-181920), as indicated by the American Institute of Physics (AIP). Financial security is a significant aspiration for me.* Data science and computer software roles account for a larger share of positions that astrophysics PhD graduates fill, according to the same AIP source.* I do not relish academic writing, grant applications, or the competitive nature of academia. However, I thoroughly enjoy coding and data interpretation.* I also desire a job that offers a better work-life balance than academia. I wish to enjoy weekends and vacations without guilt, something I find research impedes.Given this context, I have several questions:* After I pass my candidacy this month, what steps can I take from then until the end of my PhD to enhance my coding skills and prepare for a career in data science, computer software, or machine learning? Should I seek online resources, or should I enroll in a data science course at my university and persuade my advisor to support this decision?* Do many astrophysics PhD graduates working in data science or computer software do so because they initially sought academic positions but transitioned after unsuccessful attempts, or do they choose this path early in their PhDs, knowing they did not wish to remain in academia?* Considering my firm decision against pursuing a tenure-track professorship or continuing in research post-PhD, would it be more advantageous to remain in the program and concurrently develop data science skills, or should I consider leaving the program? I am apprehensive about exiting the program as I have formed significant connections during my graduate studies, and I fear that leaving might lead to difficulty in finding employment and potentially having to live with my parents, as is the case with my sibling. I would also feel guilty for leaving my advisor because they have been so nice and patient with me and I feel that I would hurt their tenure review if their first student left.",reddit,5

And would really be par for the course as far as the ""weirdness"" of reality. Anyway, it got me thinking, wouldn't that fit perfectly with our idea of what matter was doing during and moments after the Big Bang?It's my understanding that elements are thought to not survive being pulled into a black hole. They are reduced down to fundamental particles. So assuming there is a universe inside each black hole, wouldn't the beginning of those universes look exactly like ours? At the ""beginning"", or I guess, the other side of the black hole, there are just particles, which assuming the physics is the same, would quickly assemble into hydrogen, and the process as we know it begins.

I've hit a snag in my calculations. While I'm getting results in units of W/m\^2, I really need them in Joules. I've determined the temperature of the CMB using redshift z and then applied the Stefan-Boltzmann law, resulting in E=σT\^4. Given that T is in Kelvin and σ is in W/m\^2K\^4, it naturally yields W/m\^2. My aim is to find the energy for a certain volume of the CMB, say m\^3. Multiplying Energy Density by this volume gives me W/m. Now, I've come across mentions of converting blackbody radiation to Joules using a factor of 4/c, but I'm struggling to find a solid source on this. Does anyone know how this works and could point me to some reliable sources?Thanks for reading",reddit,4
